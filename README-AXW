Module Architecture: For my module organization I organized my characters and thieir classes as recommended. 
I created a dictionary for each character and I completed the save character function so that I could save the dictionary data in a file.

AI Usage: AI helped me with alot of this project because this assignment was really confusing. 
One example of AI assistance is when it helped me fix my comparison logic and dictionary syntax errors when I was working with the inventory systems py.

Exception Strategy: When raising exceptions, I was creating outputs for common errors that could occure while one was playing my game. 
For example, a common mistake is mispelling a word. If a user misspells a item ID, then an exception will be raised because that ID doesn't mathc the one in the item dictionary.

How to play my game: I didn't finish my program completly, so my gameplay won't function as expected.
